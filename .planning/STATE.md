# Project State: Necto - Institutional DePIN Router Interface

**Created:** February 11, 2026
**Last Updated:** February 11, 2026

## Project Reference

**Core Value:** Infrastructure teams can execute compliant compute procurement with seamless automation - if the system can't find verified providers, route jobs automatically, and maintain audit trails for regulators, the entire value proposition fails for enterprise adoption.

**Current Focus:** Transform institutional infrastructure procurement through seamless automation across DePIN networks without Web3 complexity.

**Success Depends On:** Seamless execution, 70%+ cost savings vs traditional cloud, zero compliance violations, and operational efficiency through single interface.

## Current Position

### Active Phase
**Phase 1 - Foundation Interface**
- **Goal:** Users can navigate the platform and see real-time cost advantages
- **Status:** Not Started
- **Progress:** ████░░░░░░ 0%

### Current Plan
No active execution plan. Roadmap complete, ready for phase planning.

**Next Action:** Execute `/gsd:plan-phase 1` to begin Phase 1 implementation.

### Roadmap Status
- **Total Phases:** 4
- **Phases Complete:** 0/4
- **Requirements Mapped:** 26/26 ✓
- **Coverage:** 100%

## Performance Metrics

### Development Velocity
- **Plans Executed:** 0
- **Phases Completed:** 0
- **Avg Phase Duration:** TBD
- **On-Track Percentage:** N/A (project start)

### Quality Indicators
- **Requirements Coverage:** 100% ✓
- **Success Criteria per Phase:** 4-7 (well-scoped)
- **Phase Dependencies:** Clear and logical
- **Research Integration:** High (comprehensive domain research completed)

### Risk Assessment
- **Technical Risk:** Medium (Next.js 14 + DePIN integration complexity)
- **Compliance Risk:** High (enterprise regulatory requirements)
- **Market Risk:** Medium (DePIN network reliability dependencies)
- **Execution Risk:** Low (clear phase structure with observable success criteria)

## Accumulated Context

### Key Decisions Made
1. **Phase Structure:** 4 phases derived from natural requirement groupings and dependencies
2. **Foundation First:** UI shell and cost visualization before complex integrations
3. **Progressive Network Integration:** Akash/Render in Phase 3, Aethir in Phase 4
4. **Audit Early:** Compliance framework starts in Phase 3 to support enterprise adoption

### Active Todos
- [ ] Execute Phase 1 planning and implementation
- [ ] Validate cyberpunk-professional design system approach
- [ ] Confirm DePIN network API access and integration requirements
- [ ] Establish enterprise compliance framework baseline

### Resolved Blockers
None yet - project initialization complete.

### Open Blockers
None identified - ready to proceed with Phase 1.

## Session Continuity

### Last Session Summary
- **Action:** Created project roadmap from requirements
- **Outcome:** 4-phase roadmap with 100% requirement coverage
- **Key Insight:** Foundation → Discovery → Integration → Optimization provides natural progression
- **Files Created:** ROADMAP.md, STATE.md
- **Files Updated:** REQUIREMENTS.md (traceability section)

### Context for Next Session
The roadmap provides a clear path from basic UI foundation through full enterprise compliance. Phase 1 focuses on establishing the professional platform shell with live cost comparison data - the foundation that makes the value proposition immediately visible to enterprise users.

Key research insights inform implementation:
- **Stack:** Next.js 14 App Router, Shadcn UI, React Flow, TanStack for high-performance tables
- **Architecture:** Event-driven microservices with financial terminal patterns
- **Pitfalls:** Focus on regulatory compliance early, avoid real-time system failures

**Ready for:** Phase 1 planning and execution via `/gsd:plan-phase 1`

### Continuity Artifacts
- **ROADMAP.md:** Complete phase structure and success criteria
- **REQUIREMENTS.md:** Updated with phase mappings and traceability
- **PROJECT.md:** Core value and constraints reference
- **research/*.md:** Comprehensive domain research for implementation guidance
